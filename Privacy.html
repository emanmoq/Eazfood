                                the "EzeFood Services"). For avoidance of doubt, EzeFood does not prepare or fulfil any
                                orders for Goods or provide delivery services directly and no members of the EzeFood
                                Group will be liable for any transactions between Customers, Couriers or Vendors.
                                EzeFood may provide products or services to Couriers or Vendors through a separate
                                agreement executed with such parties. Menus and other Vendor-related information on the

                            <li>EzeFood Customer Account<br>To use the EzeFood Platform and most features of the EzeFood
                                Services, you are required to successfully create a user account (the "EzeFood Customer

                    </ol>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have created your EzeFood Customer Account you may
                    select Goods from a Vendor’s menu, choose your desired quantities, and then add them to your cart.
                    Your cart may be edited at any time prior to placing an Order. Once you have made your selection,
                    you may proceed to place your Order. At this time you will have the opportunity to review your cart
                    items. After you review and confirm that the items in your cart are correct, you may proceed to
                    place your Order, provide your payment card information or select the cash payment option, if
                    available, and an Order will be created and sent to the Vendor. You are responsible to ensure that
                    all of your Order details, including billing, delivery address and other information is current,
                    complete and accurate. Your payment card will be charged when you place your Order if the Order is a
                    Card Order (as defined in subsection 6 below). Once you have placed your Order, you will not be
                    entitled to change or cancel your Order and you will not be entitled to a refund (except where
                    required by law). Notwithstanding that you are not entitled as of right to change or cancel your
                    Order or be entitled to a refund (except where prohibited by law), if you wish to amend or cancel
                    your Order for a total or partial refund of your Order’s price, you must get in touch with EzeFood
                    via chat, email or the EzeFood support phone line at the contact information provided on the EzeFood
                    Platform.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We encourage Vendors to confirm all Orders and to
                    communicate any inability or unwillingness to confirm promptly, and we will notify you as soon as
                    reasonably practicable if the Vendor does not confirm your Order. Vendors may have the discretion to
                    not confirm Orders. For Card Orders (as defined in subsection 6 below), EzeFood will provide you
                    with a refund of the price of your Order after communicating to you the non- confirmation or
                    cancellation of your Order by the Vendor.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of standard
                    banking procedures, once you have placed a Card Order and your payment has been authorised, your
                    bank or card issuer will "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order. If your Order is not confirmed
                    by the Vendor or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the
                    funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available
                    balance. However, this may take a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to
                    30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that no members of the
                    EzeFood Group nor the relevant Vendor will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay
                    by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your
                    account.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that EzeFood or the Vendor will have no
                    liability to you for Orders that are not confirmed, are cancelled or that the Vendor has been unable
                    or unwilling to fulfill.<ol>

                    QUALITY OF THE GOODS DELIVERED INCLUDING IF GOODS CAUSE ILLNESS, ALLERGIC REACTIONS OR HAVE

                        <li>Gift Card Terms and EzeFood Credits</li>
                    </ol>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EzeFood may grant you credit toward eligible purchases as set
                    out in these terms ("Eligible Purchases") in the form of EzeFood gift cards ("Gift Cards") or
                    EzeFood credit ("EzeFood Credit"). When you purchase a Gift Card, you are purchasing credit toward
                    Eligible Purchases in a particular dollar amount and currency that is stored in an electronic form
                    and linked to a unique gift card claim code ("Claim Code"). To use a Gift Card, you must have an
                    EzeFood Customer Account, log in to your EzeFood Customer Account, and apply the Gift Card to your
                    EzeFood Customer Account by entering the Claim Code on the EzeFood Platform. EzeFood Credit is
                    credit toward Eligible Purchases in a particular dollar amount that is associated with a unique
                    EzeFood Customer Account. The value of EzeFood Credit including credit from Gift Cards applied to
                    your EzeFood Customer Account is referred to as your "EzeFood Credit Balance". When you apply a Gift
                    Card to your EzeFood Customer Account, your EzeFood Credit Balance will be credited by the dollar
                    value of the Gift Card, and the value associated with the Claim Code will be reduced to zero. From
                    time to time, EzeFood may also issue EzeFood Credit to you for other purposes (for example, to
                    refund a purchase that you have made). Your EzeFood Credit Balance includes the total remaining
                    balance of all EzeFood Credit that has been applied to your EzeFood Customer Account by way of Gift
                    Card or otherwise, but not yet applied to a purchase. To check your EzeFood Credit Balance, log in
                    to your EzeFood Customer Account. To check the balance of a Gift Card before it has been applied to
                    an EzeFood Customer Account, simply review the email or other document in which you received the
                    Gift Card, where the face value will be printed.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eligible
                    Purchases that you may purchase using Gift Cards and EzeFood Credit consist of Goods, including all
                    fees and costs on the Order for those Goods which you are permitted to purchase in accordance with
                    these Terms of Service. EzeFood reserves the right to restrict the use of Gift Cards and EzeFood
                    Credit to comply with applicable law. Gift Cards and EzeFood Credit cannot be used to purchase
                    anything other than Eligible Purchases and must be used in the currency in which they were paid or
                    credited for.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you make a purchase from your EzeFood
                    Customer Account using EzeFood Credit (including EzeFood Credit from a Gift Card), the value of the
                    EzeFood Credit that you use for that purchase will be deducted from your EzeFood Credit Balance. As
                    long as you are only purchasing Eligible Purchases, you may use EzeFood Credit to pay for all fees
                    and costs on your Order, including but not limited to the cost of Goods, delivery charges, tips, and
                    taxes. Any unused EzeFood Credit Balance will remain associated with your EzeFood Customer Account.
                    If the cost of an Order exceeds your EzeFood Credit Balance, the remaining amount must be paid with
                    another payment method.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift Cards and EzeFood Credit do not
                    expire. There are no fees associated with purchasing, using, or redeeming Gift Cards or EzeFood
                    Credit.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift Cards and EzeFood Credit cannot be resold (except
                    with the express written permission of EzeFood), used for payment outside the Eligible Purchases,
                    transferred for value, returned for a cash refund, or redeemed for cash, except to the extent
                    required by applicable law. Gift Cards cannot be reloaded. No portion of your EzeFood Credit Balance
                    may be transferred to another EzeFood Customer Account or otherwise assigned or transferred to
                    another person. EzeFood Credit cannot be used in conjunction with Cash
                    Orders.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The risk of loss and title for Gift Cards pass to the
                    purchaser upon our electronic transmission of the Gift Card to the purchaser or designated
                    recipient. EzeFood is not responsible if any Gift Card is lost, stolen or destroyed, if your EzeFood
                    Credit Balance or any Gift Card is used without your permission, or if you lose access to your
                    EzeFood Customer Account or any EzeFood Credits.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift Cards and
                    EzeFood Credit may be subject to any additional terms and conditions that will be specified in
                    connection with the specific Gift Card and EzeFood Credit
                    grant.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EzeFood has the right to void Gift Cards or EzeFood
                    Credit, close EzeFood Customer Accounts and bill alternative forms of payment if it suspects that a
                    Gift Card is obtained, used or applied to an EzeFood Customer Account (or EzeFood Credit is applied
                    to a purchase) fraudulently, unlawfully or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service, or in a
                    manner that abuses the EzeFood Platform.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For greater certainty,
                    to the extent permitted by law, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to add
                    to or amend terms and conditions (including these Terms of Service) in relation to the use of Gift
                    Cards or EzeFood Credit<ol>
                        <li>Contests/Competitions</li>
                    </ol>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, EzeFood may run contests or competitions
                    ("Contests"). Those Contests will be subject to these Terms of Service, as well as rules specific to
                    each Contest ("Contest Rules").&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, Contests for
                    Canadian users will be open to individual residents of Canada over the age of majority in the
                    province or territory in which they reside, with the exception of:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    employees, representatives and agents (and persons with whom they are domiciled, whether related or
                    not) of EzeFood Group, its advertising and promotion agencies; and&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    residents of Quebec, unless specified in the Contest Rules.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                    Contest Rules may specify other eligibility rules.&nbsp;●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For greater
                    certainty, subject to applicable law, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion,
                    to withdraw any Contest, to add to or amend terms and conditions (including these Terms of Service)
                    in relation to any Contest or to vary or terminate the operation of a Contest at any time without
                    notice.
